# CebuanoLLPSIConcept
A basic webpage that currently consists of only one Cebuano passage, heavily based on the first chapter of the lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, book. 

I created this because I noticed that there wasn't any material for learning Cebuano, that takes the Comprehensible Input approach. So I decided to create this to combine
my interests in coding, as well as language learning, to create a basic webpage. Hopefully I can expand upon a comprenhensible input concept like this in the future through more original content.

This website is still a work in progress but in the 
future, I aim to add basic interactive quizzes, more original
readings, including diacritics to help with pronunciation, and even accompanying audio.
Below you can find the currently available content.
