# CebuanoLLPSIConcept
Heavily based on works like Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, I created this because I noticed
that there aren't too much material for learning Cebuano, that takes the Comprehensible Input approach.

This website is still a work in progress but, on it, you can find a small amount of articles, written in
simple Cebuano. At the moment, it is a simple website, but in the future, I aim to add some interactive quizzes, more original readings, including toggles for diacritics to help with pronunciations, maybe a badlit/kudlit toggle and audio as well.
