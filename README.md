# CebuanoLLPSIConcept
A basic webpage of a Cebuano excerpt written based on the very first chapter of Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata. 

I created this because I noticed that there wasn't any material for learning Cebuano, that takes the Comprehensible Input approach. So I decided to create this to combine
my interests in coding, as well as language learning, to create a basic webpage. Hopefully I will expand upon this concept a lot more in the future!
