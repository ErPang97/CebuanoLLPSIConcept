                <p> Hello! It is the author here: </p>
                <p>
                    I came across the comprehensible input method of learning languages
                    recently and it is now my principle way of approaching how I learn languages. 
                    Books like Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, The Story Learning Series, and 
                    several other language learning content creators have inspired me to try to 
                    create similar work in other languages. However, in trying to learn my family's 
                    mother tongue, I noticed that there is quite a lack of material created for 
                    learners of Cebuano.</p>
                    <p>
                    Before beginning, I assume that if you found this website, you know what Cebuano
                    is. If not, no worries! Cebuano is one of the most spoken langauges in the
                    Philippines. It is an Austronesian language, in the Philippine language family, 
                    and is one of the many different, yet closely related Visayan languages. 
                    You may have heard it be called Bisaya, as it is commonly known over there, 
                    but it is a bit of a misnomer, as Cebuano just refers to the most widely 
                    spoken of the Visayan languages. 
                    </p>
                <p> So, in order to improve my own Cebuano as well and to help others learn it, 
                    I decided to make this website which will include basic articles and stories
                    that are similar in content to the works that inspired me above. 
                    I hope that through this endeavor, I can help not only myself practice my language,
                    but others as well!</p>
                <p> <b>Corrections:</b> I am not a fluent speaker, but I grew up listening as it is the 
                    language of many, in the Filipino community that I grew up in. Nevertheless, there is 
                    bound to be some mistakes. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to
