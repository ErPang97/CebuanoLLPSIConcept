                <p>I only came across the comprehensible input method of learning languages recently. It is now my 
                    principle way of approaching how I learn languages. Books like Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, The Story Learning 
                    Series, and several other language learning content creators have inspired me to try to create similar work in other 
                    languages.</p>
                <p> In order to improve my own Cebuano as well as to help others, I decided to make basic articles that are similar
                    in content. I hope that through this, I can help not only myself, but others learn the language as well! I am 
                    not a native speaker, but I grew up listening as it is the language of my parents, and the community I grew
                    up in. As a result, there is bound to be mistakes and I would appreciate any corrections!
