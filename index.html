        <h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>
        <p> The comprehensible input learning approach to language learning is my favorite method 
            to appraoch language learning. Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata is one of those books that has
            inspired me to try to create similar work in other languages, namely Cebuano.</p>
        <p> In the page below, I translated the first three paragraphs of the first chapter of Lingua Latina,
            into basic Cebuano, modifying location names to make it somewhat more relevant to the Philippines. This was
            done in order to practice writing basic Cebuano, and to see what such a text would be like. Hopefully in the future,
            I will be able to write original work in Cebuano, both as teaching material and for general self expression.
